# CacheInspector
Vlocity Digital Cache APIs

I created this tool to check the products and promotions present in the cache, for each item there is a count of how many times the element is present in the cache.
The utility of this tool is to extract the keys related to an element in order to partially clear the cache.
For example, it could happen that the configuration of a product or promotion is wrong and for this reason the cache is corrupted.
To date we do not know how to delete the individual keys but with this tool we know what are the relative CartContexKeys.
